[(Back to Top)](#)

### Action: Attack

- The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.
- With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack.
- Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.
- When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see.
- If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.
- When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden (both unseen and unheard) when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Cast a Spell

- Spellcasters have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Climb onto a Bigger Creature

- A suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb.
- After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space and clings to its body.
- While in the target's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it. The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain.
- The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to the DM's discretion.
- The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action by knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Dash

- When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.
- Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Disarm

- A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.
- The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands.
- The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Disengage

- If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Dodge

- When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.
- You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Escape a Grapple

- A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the grappling creature's Strength (Athletics) check.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Grapple

- When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple.
- If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
- The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.
- Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).
- You succeed auto­matically if the target is incapacitated.
- If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition.
- You can release the target whenever you like (no action required).
- When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Help

- You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.
- Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Hide

- The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hid­ing.
- When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide.
- Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any crea­ture that actively searches for signs of your presence.
- You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.
- An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
- In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
- When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Identify a Spell

- A character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.
- If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level.
- If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Opportunity Attack

- In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.
- You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach.
- To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.
- You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action.
- You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Overrun

- When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature.
- As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength (Athletics) check.
- The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.
- If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Ready

- Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.
- First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."
- When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.
- When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Search

- When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Shove a Creature

- Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you.
- If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
- The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.
- Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexter­ity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).
- You succeed automatically if the target is incapac­itated.
- If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.
- You can attempt to shove the target aside rather than away. You have disadvantage on your Strength (Athletics) check when you do so. If you succeed, you move the target 5 feet to a different space within your reach.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Tumble

- You can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent.
- As an action or a bonus action, you can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
- If you win the contest, you can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Two-Weapon Fighting

- When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand.
- You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.
- If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

[(Back to Actions)](#actions)

### Action: Use an Object

- You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you can open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you can draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.
- If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

[(Back to Conditions)](#conditions)

### Condition: Exhaustion

- Some special abilities and circumstanceal hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.
- Exhaustion is measured in six levels:
    - Level 1: Disadvantage on ability checks.
    - Level 2: Speed halved.
    - Level 3: Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.
    - Level 4: Hit point maximum halved.
    - Level 5: Speed reduced to 0.
    - Level 6: Death.
- A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaus­tion as well as all lower levels.
- If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.
- An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
- Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.
- Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.
- Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.

[(Back to Conditions)](#conditions)

- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

[(Back to Conditions)](#conditions)

### Condition: Squeezing

- A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it.
- While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.

[(Back to Conditions)](#conditions)

### Condition: Stunned

- A stunned creature is incapacitated, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

[(Back to Conditions)](#conditions)

### Condition: Suffocating

- A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).
- When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Consti­tution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

[(Back to Conditions)](#conditions)

### Condition: Unconscious

- An unconscious creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings
- The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a criti­cal hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Circumstance: Resting

- Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer. That being said, when sleeping at an inn or similar "safe" place, you are generally assumed to be sleeping in nightwear rather than light armor.
- When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter (rather than half) of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die), and if you have any levels of exhaustion, the long rest doesn't reduce your exhaustion level.
- Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.
- Elves and warforged do not need to remove their armor during their Trance and Sentry's Rest, respectively.

[(Back to Circumstances)](#circumstances)

### Circumstance: Jumping

- Each foot you clear while jumping costs a foot of movement.
- When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.
- When you make a long jump and land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.
- When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance.
- When you make a high jump, you can extend your arms half your height above yourself during a high jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.
- In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher or further than you normally can.

[(Back to Circumstances)](#circumstances)

### Circumstance: Falling

- At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.
- If a creature is conscious when it falls, subtract the creature's running high jump distance (3 + Strength modifier in feet) from the distance it falls before calculating falling damage.
- If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the Fly spell.
- If a flying creature is conscious when it falls, subtract the creature's current flying speed from the distance it falls before calculating falling damage.
- When a creature falls from a great height, it instantly descends up to 500 feet. If it's still falling on its next turn, it descends up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. This process continues until the fall ends, either because the creature hits the ground or the fall is otherwise halted.
- If a conscious flying creature starts its turn falling due to being prone, it can use half of its current flying speed to end the prone condition and halt its fall, as if it were standing up in midair.
- A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Athlet­ics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any dam­age resulting from the fall is halved.
- If a creature falls into the space of a second creature and neither of them is Tiny, the second creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be impacted by the falling creature, and any damage resulting from the fall is divided evenly between them. The impacted creature is also knocked prone, unless it is two or more sizes larger than the fall­ ing creature.

### Circumstance: Cover

- A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.
- If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies.
- A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.
- A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three­-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
- A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

[(Back to Circumstances)](#circumstances)

### Circumstance: Concealment and Light

- Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lan­terns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.
- Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.
- In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Charac­ters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a sub­terranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.
- A heavily obscured area such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.

[(Back to Circumstances)](#circumstances)

### Circumstance: Mounted Combat

- A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount
- Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.
- If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it.
- If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
- If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
- If your mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.
- While you're mounted, you can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.
- Controlling a mount:
  - You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training.
  - The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it.
  - A controlled mount moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.
  - A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.
- Independent mount:
  - An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order.
  - Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

[(Back to Circumstances)](#circumstances)

### Circumstance: Underwater Combat

- When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
- A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a thrown javelin, spear, trident, or dart.
- Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.
