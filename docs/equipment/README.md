[(Back to Top)](#)

Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. Light armor takes 1 minute to don or doff.

| Light Armor | Cost  | Weight | Description |
| :---------- | :---: | :----: | :---------- |
| Padded armor | 5 gp | 8 lb | Armor Class = 11 + Dexterity modifier. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting. |
| Leather armor | 10 gp | 10 lb | Armor Class = 11 + Dexterity modifier. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials. |
| Studded leather armor | 45 gp | 13 lb | Armor Class = 12 + Dexterity modifier. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes. |

[(Back to Armor)](#armor)

### Medium Armor

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. Medium armor takes 5 minutes to don and 1 minute to doff.

| Medium Armor | Cost  | Weight | Description |
| :----------- | :---: | :----: | :---------- |
| Hide armor | 10 gp | 12 lb | Armor Class = 12 + Dex modifier (max 2). This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor. |
| Chain shirt armor | 50 gp | 20 lb | Armor Class = 13 + Dex modifier (max 2). Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers. |
| Scale mail armor | 50 gp | 45 lb | Armor Class = 14 + Dex modifier (max 2). Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets. |
| Breastplate armor | 400 gp | 20 lb | Armor Class = 14 + Dex modifier (max 2). This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered. |
| Half plate armor | 750 gp | 40 lb | Armor Class = 15 + Dex modifier (max 2). Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Half plate armor consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps. |

[(Back to Armor)](#armor)

### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative. Heavy armor takes 10 minutes to don and 5 minutes to doff. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If an armor has a Strength requirement, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

| Heavy Armor | Cost  | Weight | Description |
| :---------- | :---: | :----: | :---------- |
| Ring mail armor | 30 gp | 40 lb | Armor Class = 14. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor. |
| Chain mail armor | 75 gp | 55 lb | Armor Class = 16. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Requires a Strength score of 13. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets. |
| Splint armor | 200 gp | 60 lb | Armor Class = 17. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Requires a Strength score of 15. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints. |
| Plate armor | 1,500 gp | 65 lb | Armor Class = 18. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Requires a Strength score of 15. Plate armor consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate armor includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body. |

### Shield

Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield. A shield takes 1 action to don or doff.

| Shield | Cost  | Weight | Description |
| :----- | :---: | :----: | :---------- |
| Shield | 10 gp | 6 lb | Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. |

## Poisons

- [Inhaled Poisons](#inhaled-poisons)
- [Injury Poisons](#injury-poisons)

[(Back to Top)](#)

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures. Poison is generally stored in a vial (1 gp, 0 lb) such that each vial contains one dose of the poison.

### Contact Poisons

Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

| Contact Poison | Cost  | Description |
| :------------- | :---: | :---------- |
| Carrion crawler mucus | 200 gp | This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated carrion crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. |
| Oil of Taggit | 400 gp | A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage. |

[(Back to Poisons)](#poisons)

### Ingested Poisons

A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. Applying the poison to food or a liquid takes an action. The Dungeon Master may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

| Ingested Poison | Cost  | Description |
| :-------------- | :---: | :---------- |
| Assassin’s blood poison | 150 gp | A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d12 poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn’t poisoned. |
| Truth serum | 150 gp | A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can’t knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a Zone of Truth spell. |
| Pale tincture poison | 250 gp | A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 1d6 poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can’t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally. |
| Torpor poison | 600 gp | A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated. |
| Midnight tears poison | 1,500 gp | A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 9d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |

[(Back to Poisons)](#poisons)

### Inhaled Poisons

These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Releasing the poison takes an action. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

| Inhaled Poison | Cost  | Description |
| :------------- | :---: | :---------- |
| Malice poison | 250 gp | A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded. |
| Essence of ether | 300 gp | A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. |
| Burnt othur fumes | 500 gp | A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 1d6 poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends. |

[(Back to Poisons)](#poisons)

### Injury Poisons

Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects. One vial of injury poison can be used to coat one slashing or piercing weapon, one trap component, or one piece of ammunition.

| Injury Poison | Cost  | Description |
| :------------ | :---: | :---------- |
| Basic poison | 100 gp | You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. |
| Serpent venom | 200 gp | This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| Drow poison | 200 gp | This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. |
| Wyvern poison | 1,200 gp | This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
