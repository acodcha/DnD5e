### Travel: Tack

Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor can be made as barding, but it costs and weighs more. A military saddle gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.

### Travel: Land Vehicles

Land vehicles must be drawn by a mount. Generally, a mount can draw a land vehicle one size larger than itself, and multiple mounts can be used to draw a land vehicle faster.

### Travel: Waterborne Vehicles

The speed of a waterborne vehicle depends on the speed and direction of the water current. A typical water current speed is about 3 mph. Add the speed of the water current to the vehicle's speed while taking the directions into account to determine the vehicle's net speed. If a vehicle is using sails, its listed speed assumes there is a decent breeze and that the vehicle is sailing with the wind; sailing into the wind is much slower.

| Waterborne Vehicle | Capacity                                 | Propulsion    | Speed  |      Cost |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------ | :----- | --------: |
