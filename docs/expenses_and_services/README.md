### Travel: Pace

Characters traveling on foot, on a mount, or aboard a land vehicle move at the same travel pace, choosing between a slow, normal, or fast pace:

| Type   |          Travel Pace           | Effect |
| :----- | :----------------------------: | :----- |
| Slow   | 200 ft/min, 2 mi/hr, 18 mi/day | Able to use stealth |
| Normal | 300 ft/min, 3 mi/hr, 24 mi/day | – |
| Fast   | 400 ft/min, 4 mi/hr, 30 mi/day | −5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) |

Terrain affects your travel pace:

- Paved road: normal travel pace.
- Unpaved path: reduces your travel pace to three quarters of its normal value.
- Cross-country through normal terrain such as grass, soil, or rock: reduces your travel pace to half of its normal value.
- Cross-country through difficult terrain such as sand, mud, forests, swamps, hills, mountains, ice, or snow: reduces your travel pace to one quarter of its normal value.

Bad weather such as heavy rains, blizzards, or hurricane winds can slow your travel pace even further.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, a character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, the character suffers one level of exhaustion

A mounted character can ride at a gallop for up to one hour, covering 8 miles.

Characters traveling in waterborne vehicles travel at the pace of that vehicle. Depending on the vehicle and its crew, it may be possible to travel for 24 hours a day.

Characters traveling using motorized vehicles, magic, or flying mounts travel at a pace that depends on the speed of the motorized vehicle, magical effect, or flying mount:

| Speed  |        Slow Travel Pace         |        Normal Travel Pace         |          Fast Travel Pace          |

|  80 ft | 550 ft/min, 5½ mi/hr, 44 mi/day |   800 ft/min,  8 mi/hr, 64 mi/day | 1,100 ft/min, 11 mi/hr,  88 mi/day |
|  90 ft | 600 ft/min,  6 mi/hr, 48 mi/day |   900 ft/min,  9 mi/hr, 72 mi/day | 1,200 ft/min, 12 mi/hr,  96 mi/day |
| 100 ft | 650 ft/min, 6½ mi/hr, 52 mi/day | 1,000 ft/min, 10 mi/hr, 80 mi/day | 1,300 ft/min, 13 mi/hr, 104 mi/day |
| 110 ft | 750 ft/min, 7½ mi/hr, 60 mi/day | 1,100 ft/min, 11 mi/hr, 88 mi/day | 1,500 ft/min, 15 mi/hr, 120 mi/day |

- **Watch for Danger:** Contribute your passive Wisdom (Perception) score to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.
- **Navigate or Track:** Navigate the wilderness or follow tracks to avoid getting lost.
- **Draw a Map:** Chart the group's progress. Helps the group get back on track if it gets lost.

### Travel: Tack

Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor can be made as barding, but it costs and weighs more. A military saddle gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.

| Tack            |  Cost | Weight |
| :-------------- | ----: | -----: |
| Bit and bridle  |  2 gp |   1 lb |
| Saddlebags      |  4 gp |   8 lb |
| Pack saddle     |  5 gp |  15 lb |
| Riding saddle   | 10 gp |  25 lb |

### Travel: Land Vehicles

Land vehicles must be drawn by a mount. Generally, a mount can draw a land vehicle one size larger than itself, and multiple mounts can be used to draw a land vehicle faster.

### Travel: Waterborne Vehicles

The speed of a waterborne vehicle depends on the speed and direction of the water current. A typical water current speed is about 3 mph. Add the speed of the water current to the vehicle's speed while taking the directions into account to determine the vehicle's net speed. If a vehicle is using sails, its listed speed assumes there is a decent breeze and that the vehicle is sailing with the wind; sailing into the wind is much slower.

| Waterborne Vehicle | Capacity                                 | Propulsion    | Speed  |      Cost |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------ | :----- | --------: |
| Canoe              | 2 crew, 200 lb cargo                     | Paddles       | 1½ mph |     30 gp |
| Rowboat            | 2 crew, 2 passengers, 400 lb cargo       | Oars          | 1½ mph |     50 gp |
| Keelboat           | 3 crew, 4 passengers, 1,000 lb cargo     | Oars or sails | 1 mph  |  3,000 gp |

## Hirelings

Some hirelings might require a minimum of several days or even weeks of pay for a given job, and might ask for some or all of their pay up front. Furthermore, danger implies higher pay: if there is a possibility of combat or similar hazard, hirelings generally require double pay, and hirelings outright refuse to go on suicide missions.
