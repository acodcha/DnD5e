### Consent: Story Elements

The players and the Game Master must each carefully read and fill out the [RPG Consent Checklist](https://mcpl.info/sites/default/files/images/consent-in-gaming-form-fillable-checklist-2019-09-13.pdf). Players hand the checklist over to the Game Master before the start of the campaign, such that the Game Master then aggregates and anonymizes the results and posts them for the gaming group to see. Players and the Game Master are expected to adhere to these restrictions on story elements during play. Failure to do so will result in warnings, and serious or repeated offences will result in expulsion from the gaming group.

[(Back to Consent)](#consent)

### Consent: Player Character Interactions

Whenever a player character wishes to take an action that may directly harm or inconvenience another player character, both players must consent to that action; otherwise, the action cannot be taken. Some examples include: pocketing more than your fair share of looted treasure, stealing from a companion, including a companion in the area of effect of a spell, purposefully attacking a companion, purposefully pushing a companion off a ledge, or speaking ill of a companion to an important non-player character.

Similarly, player characters in the same adventuring party are assumed to be sufficiently familiar with each other that they cannot effectively deceive or cheat each other.

- [Race](#character-creation-race)
- [Class](#character-creation-class)
- [Background](#character-creation-background)
- [Personality](#character-creation-personality)
- [Backstory](#character-creation-backstory)
- [Portrait](#character-creation-portrait)

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Character Creation: Basics

When making your character, you may choose your race, subrace, background, class(es), subclass(es), feats, spells, and equipment from any of the official published 5th Edition Dungeon and Dragons books by Wizards of the Coast. You may not use any Unearthed Arcana material, playtest material, or homebrew material.

Unless otherwise stated, start with 0 XP at 1st level. If you are creating a replacement character because your previous character died or was retired, consult the Game Master regarding your starting experience and level.

Use the Point Buy system for your starting ability scores. For a list of all possible starting ability score arrays using the Point Buy system, see [Character Creation – Ability Scores](../character_creation#ability-scores).

Always take the average value for your hit points at 1st level.

| Hit Die | Hit points at 1st level |
| :-----: | :---------------------: |
|    d6   |  6 + Constitution modifier |
|    d8   |  8 + Constitution modifier |
|   d10   | 10 + Constitution modifier |
|   d12   | 12 + Constitution modifier |

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Race

You may customize your race as described in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*. You cannot choose a race that has a base flying speed, such as the Aarakocra, the Winged Tiefling, the Fairy, and so on.

Some races are missing official heights and weights, and some races have inconsistent heights and weights. See [Character Creation – Height and Weight](../character_creation/#height-and-weight) for more consistent height and weight data. Your height and weight must lie within the minimum and maximum bounds of this data for your race.

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Class

Regarding your 1st-level class, use the variant rule from the *Player's Handbook* where you start with coinage instead of equipment. This starting coinage depends only on your 1st-level class; you do not receive any starting coinage or equipment from your background. Use your starting coinage to purchase your starting equipment. See [Character Creation – Wealth](../character_creation#wealth) for a list of starting coinage by class. Do not roll dice; simply take the average value.

Above 1st level, you may multiclass. Your multiclass selections must make sense given your character's backstory and experiences during the campaign.

If you have one or more levels in the cleric class, your alignment must match the alignment of your deity, and your cleric domain must match one of the domains of your deity. Make careful note of the tenets of your deity; your behavior must be consistent with the tenets of your deity. If you stray from the tenets of your deity, you run the risk of losing your cleric class features and spells. Depending on the severity of your infractions, you may or may not be able to recover your cleric class features and spells.

If you have one or more levels in the paladin class, make careful note of the tenets of your sacred oath; your alignment and behavior must be consistent with the tenets of your sacred oath. If you stray from the tenets of your sacred oath, you run the risk of losing your paladin class features and spells. Depending on the severity of your infractions, you may or may not be able to recover your paladin class features and spells. If you abandon your sacred oath completely, you might become an Oathbreaker paladin as described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

If you have one or more levels in the warlock class, carefully detail your pact with your otherwordly patron. Depending on the specifics of your pact and the disposition of your otherwordly patron, your otherwordly patron may or may not tolerate your straying from your pact, in which case you may or may not run the risk of losing your warlock class features and spells.

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Background

You may customize your background as described in the *Player's Handbook*. In summary:

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Each background grants proficiency in two skills. You may choose any two skills.
- **Language and Tool Proficiencies:** Each background grants proficiency in either two languages, two tools, or one language and one tool. You may choose any of these three options, and make any choices within that option. Languages and tools are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Additional details regarding tools are described in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*.
- **Starting Equipment:** Since we are using the variant rule where you start with coinage instead of equipment, you do not receive any starting coinage or equipment from your background.
- **Feature:** Each background grants a passive feature. This is what effectively identifies the background, so you gain this feature as usual.

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Personality

Your alignment, personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw must:

- fit the campaign setting and tone,
- be consistent with the adventuring party's goal,
- be such that you want to go on adventures with the adventuring party, and
- be such that you generally get along with your fellow adventuring party members.

You may choose your two personality traits, your ideal, your bond, and your flaw from any background. See:

- [Character Creation – Personality Traits](../character_creation/#personality-traits) for a list of personality traits from all backgrounds,
- [Character Creation – Ideals](../character_creation/#ideals) for a list of ideals from all backgrounds,
- [Character Creation – Bonds](../character_creation/#bonds) for a list of bonds from all backgrounds, and
- [Character Creation – Flaws](../character_creation/#flaws) for a list of flaws from all backgrounds.

Your bond must involve one of your fellow adventuring party members. You may optionally have a second bond unrelated to the adventuring party.

You are assumed to have a modest lifestyle, and lifestyle expenses are ignored.

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Backstory

Write a short backstory of a few paragraphs. The purpose of your backstory is to explain your background, your bond, your 1st-level class, and your other character details. Your backstory must include the following:

- **Background:** One paragraph of your backstory must explain your background, including any non-player characters or factions from your background's passive feature.
- **Bond:** One paragraph of your backstory must explain your bond(s).
- **Class:** One paragraph of your backstory must explain your 1st-level class and subclass as well as any other classes you plan on taking in the future if you choose to multiclass.
- You may optionally write one or more additional paragraphs to explain your alignment, personality traits, ideal, and flaw.

Your backstory must fit the campaign setting and tone, and your backstory must be appropriate for your starting level. Greatness is something that is earned while adventuring, not something that is written into a backstory.

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Portrait

Find an image depicting your character, ideally a full-body image or a "from the waist up" image, to serve as your character's portrait. Your portrait must fit the campaign setting and tone, and your portrait cannot be lewd or inappropriate. This portrait will be used to create a token for your character.

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

## Advancement

- [Levelling](#advancement-levelling)
- [Absenteeism](#advancement-absenteeism)
- [Death and Retirement](#advancement-death-and-retirement)

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Advancement: Levelling

Your character can only gain new levels in-between game sessions. When you acquire enough experience points to gain a new level, continue gaining experience points as usual, but wait until the end of the game session to gain your new level. Gain the benefits of your new level immediately, including new spell slots or nearly-learned spells, even if the session ended in the middle of a combat. Furthermore, if you are able to prepare additional spells, you may do so immediately, although you cannot change your previously-prepared spells as usual.

Always take the average value for hit points gained above 1st level.

| Hit Die | Hit points gained per level above 1st level |
| :-----: | :-----------------------------------------: |
|    d6   | 4 + Constitution modifier |
|    d8   | 5 + Constitution modifier |
|   d10   | 6 + Constitution modifier |
|   d12   | 7 + Constitution modifier |

Remember that if your Constitution modifier changes, you must recalculate your 1st-level and higher-level hit points as if you had always had that different modifier.

[(Back to Advancement)](#advancement)

### Advancement: Absenteeism

If you are absent during a game session, your character fades into the background of the story: you are assumed to follow the adventuring party around, but you cannot directly impact the game, and the game cannot directly impact you. While absent, you do not receive any experience points or treasure except for treasure hoards and quest rewards.

Strictly more than half of all players must be present for a game session to take place. If there are not enough players, the game session will be cancelled.

Please inform the Game Master ahead of time if you will be absent from a game session or if you will be late to a game session.

Game session notes in the form of an adventuring journal are kept by the Game Master and posted publicly. At the beginning of each game session, the previous session's journal is read as a recap. If you are absent from a game session, it is your responsibility to read the game session notes that would have been recapped during the game sessions you missed, so make sure to schedule some time to do so.

[(Back to Advancement)](#advancement)

### Advancement: Death and Retirement

If your character dies or retires, you may make a new character. Your new character starts with the same total experience points as your previous one. Consult the game master when making a new character.

If a player is present at the game table, they gain experience points. Experience points are considered to be a property of the player that carry over to the player's current character. Thus, experience points transfer from a player's dead or retired character to their next character. If a player's character dies or retires during a game session and the player does not yet have a replacement character, the player continues to gain experience points during the session as long as they are present.

Unlike experience points, treasure and equipment is lost when your character dies or retires. If you have enough experience points for your new character to start at 2nd level or higher, you start with additional wealth, which you can use to purchase additional mundane or magic equipment in addition to your normal 1st-level starting equipment. Your additional starting wealth depends on your level; see [Character Creation – Starting Wealth](../character_creation/#starting-wealth) and consult the Game Master.

## Adventuring

- [Going Unconscious](#adventuring-going-unconscious)
- [Movement](#adventuring-movement)
- [Falling](#adventuring-falling)
- [Resting](#adventuring-resting)

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Adventuring: Going Unconscious

Each time you are incapacitated from being reduced to 0 hit points, you gain one level of exhaustion.

After you make a death saving throw but before it takes effect, you may choose to gain two levels of exhaustion to reroll your death saving throw, using either result.

[(Back to Adventuring)](#adventuring)

### Adventuring: Movement

Movement on a grid uses the 3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragons rule for diagonal movement: every second diagonal grid tile of movement on a 5-foot grid costs an additional 5 feet of movement. This simple rule very closely approximates real diagonal movement.

Vertical climbing, flying, and hovering movement is counted separately from horizontal movement, even when moving diagonally-upwards or diagonally-downwards.

Flying and hovering speeds apply to horizontal and downwards flight. Upwards flight is more strenuous: each foot of upwards flight costs an additional foot of movement.

[(Back to Adventuring)](#adventuring)

### Adventuring: Falling

When you fall, if you are conscious, subtract your running high jump distance (3 ft + your Strength modifier in feet) from your fall distance to determine your effective fall distance. When you land, you take bludgeoning damage based on your size and your effective fall distance as shown in the following table. You can make a Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage taken. The DC for this save equals 10 + 1 for each 10 ft of effective fall distance. You also fall prone if you take any damage from falling. Landing in water or on some similarly soft or deformable ground halves this damage.

|  Distance  | Save DC | Tiny  | Small | Medium | Large  |  Huge  | Garg.  |
| :--------: | :-----: | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
|   0–9 ft   |    –    |   –   |    –  |    –   |    –   |    –   |    –   |
|  10–19 ft  |   11    |   –   |    –  |   1d8  |   1d10 |   1d12 |   1d20 |
|  20–29 ft  |   12    |   –   |   1d6 |   3d8  |   3d10 |   3d12 |   3d20 |
|  30–39 ft  |   13    |  1d4  |   3d6 |   6d8  |   6d10 |   6d12 |   6d20 |
|  40–49 ft  |   14    |  3d4  |   6d6 |  10d8  |  10d10 |  10d12 |  10d20 |
|  50–59 ft  |   15    |  6d4  |  10d6 |  15d8  |  15d10 |  15d12 |  15d20 |
|  60–69 ft  |   16    | 10d4  |  15d6 |  21d8  |  21d10 |  21d12 |  21d20 |
|  70–79 ft  |   17    | 15d4  |  21d6 |  28d8  |  28d10 |  28d12 |  28d20 |
|  80–89 ft  |   18    | 21d4  |  28d6 |  36d8  |  36d10 |  36d12 |  36d20 |
|  90–99 ft  |   19    | 28d4  |  36d6 |  45d8  |  45d10 |  45d12 |  45d20 |
| 100–109 ft |   20    | 36d4  |  45d6 |  55d8  |  55d10 |  55d12 |  55d20 |
| 110–119 ft |   21    | 45d4  |  55d6 |  66d8  |  66d10 |  66d12 |  66d20 |
| 120–129 ft |   22    | 55d4  |  66d6 |  78d8  |  78d10 |  78d12 |  78d20 |
| 130–139 ft |   23    | 66d4  |  78d6 |  91d8  |  91d10 |  91d12 |  91d20 |
| 140–149 ft |   24    | 78d4  |  91d6 | 105d8  | 105d10 | 105d12 | 105d20 |
|   150+ ft  |   25    | 91d4  | 105d6 | 120d8  | 120d10 | 120d12 | 120d20 |

When falling from a great height, the optional rule from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* is used: you descend up to 500 feet per turn.

When a conscious flying or hovering creature falls, the optional rule from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* is also used: the creature subtracts its current flying speed from its fall distance to determine its effective fall distance.

[(Back to Adventuring)](#adventuring)

### Adventuring: Resting

The optional rules from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* concerning long rests are used with some modifications.

When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor:

- You do not regain any of your Hit Dice.
- You do not regain any of your uses of your race and class resources that are normally regained on a long rest. For example, a barbarian does not regain any uses of their rage.
- You do not regain any spell slots.
- If you have any levels of exhaustion, the long rest doesn’t reduce your exhaustion level.

Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer.

Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.

## Equipment

- [Encumbrance](#equipment-encumbrance)
- [Armor and Clothing](#equipment-armor-and-clothing)
- [Coinage](#equipment-coinage)
- [Wilderness](#equipment-wilderness)
- [Ammunition](#equipment-ammunition)
- [Thrown Weapons](#equipment-thrown-weapons)
- [Magic Items](#equipment-magic-items)

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Equipment: Encumbrance

A variant encumbrance rule is used, similar to that from the *Player's Handbook*, but slightly modified as follows:

A Medium or Small upright-standing bipedal creature such as a humanoid can carry weight in pounds up to 5 times its Strength score without penalty. Such a creature becomes encumbered if it carries weight in pounds in excess of 5 times its Strength score, or heavily encumbered if it carries weight in pounds in excess of 10 times its Strength score:

- An encumbered creature has its speed reduced by 10 feet.
- A heavily encumbered creature has its speed is reduced by 20 feet and has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. Additionally, a creature cannot fly while encumbered or heavily encumbered.

A creature that is either not bipedal or not upright-standing can carry twice as much weight: such creatures include most beasts, most beast-like monstrosities, and most dragons.

A creature larger than Medium can carry twice as much weight for each size category above Medium, while a Tiny creature can only carry one fifth as much weight as a Medium or Small creature.

For example, a draft horse is Large and not bipedal, so it can carry weight in pounds up to 20 times its Strength score without penalty, while an elephant is Huge and not bipedal, so it can carry 40 times its Strength score without penalty.

Note that the *Beast of Burden* monster trait and the *Powerful Build* racial feature change a creature's effective size for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity. Also note that many effects such as the *Polymorph* spell, the *Enlarge/Reduce* spell, the *Shapechange* monster feature, the *Wild Shape* druid class feature, and the *Giant's Might* Rune Knight fighter class feature directly change a creature's size, which also changes its carrying capacity.

[(Back to Equipment)](#equipment)

### Equipment: Armor and Clothing

Armor and clothing only weigh half their weight when worn, but weigh their regular weight when carried. All other equipment always weighs its regular weight, including shields, cloaks, boots, belts, bracers, gloves, weapons, spellcasting focuses, tools, and adventuring gear.

Armor types retain their Strength requirements, even with this variant encumbrance rule. The Strength requirements apply as follows: if an armor type has a Strength requirement, the armor reduces the wearer's speed unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. The reduction equals 5 feet for each 1 Strength score below the requirement. For example, a character with Strength 13 wearing armor with a Strength 15 requirement has its speed reduced by 10 feet.

[(Back to Equipment)](#equipment)

### Equipment: Coinage

Keep track of how many copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp) you carry on your person. 50 coins weigh 1 lb as usual. You can exchange coins for coins of different denominations in most settlements: 10 cp = 1 sp, 10 sp = 1 gp, and 10 gp = 1 pp.

Electrum pieces (ep) are not used.

Instead of carrying all of your coinage on your person, you can deposit excess coinage at a bank. Large cities are generally home to one or more well-established and reputable banks. Consult the Game Master when doing so.

[(Back to Equipment)](#equipment)

### Equipment: Wilderness

While adventuring in the wilderness, you must have the following equipment at minimum:

- Suit of armor or traveler's clothes (2 gp, 4 lb or 2 lb when worn)
- Backpack (2 gp, 5 lb)
- Bedroll (1 gp, 7 lb)
- Blanket (5 sp, 3 lb)
- Mess kit (2 sp, 1 lb)
- Waterskin (2 sp, 5 lb)

Each adventurer must have their own copy of the above equipment. However, you can ask one of your companions to carry your equipment for you.

While traveling through the wilderness, keep track of how many rations you you have as you consume them each day. You also drink the contents of one waterskin per day (or more depending on the climate), so you will usually need to find a source of water each day.

[(Back to Equipment)](#equipment)

### Equipment: Ammunition

If you carry one standard bundle of mundane ammunition along with an appropriate container for this ammunition, it is assumed that you effectively have a limitless supply of ammunition of that type, such that you do not need to keep track of its expenditure. Darts also follow this rule: if you have 10 darts, you are assumed to have an effectively limitless supply and do not need to keep track of how many you have thrown. Thus, this applies to:

- **Bow:** Quiver (1 gp, 1 lb) and 20 arrows (1 gp, 1 lb).
- **Crossbow:** Crossbow bolt case (1 gp, 1 lb) and 20 crossbow bolts (1 gp, 1.5 lb).
- **Sling:** Pouch (5 sp, 1 lb) and 20 sling bullets (4 cp, 1.5 lb).
- **Blowgun:** Pouch (5 sp, 1 lb) and 50 blowgun needles (1 gp, 1 lb).
- **Darts:** 10 darts (5 sp, 2.5 lb).

However, magical ammunition (such as a +1 arrow, +1 crossbow bolt, and so on) is expended when used.

[(Back to Equipment)](#equipment)

### Equipment: Thrown Weapons

If you carry 5 copies of a mundane melee weapon with the thrown property (such as 5 javelins, 5 handaxes, 5 daggers, and so on), you are assumed to have an effectively limitless supply of that weapon, so you do not need to keep track of how many you have thrown.

However, magical thrown weapons (such as a +1 javelin) need to be counted individually. If you have a few moments after combat, you can usually pick up your magical thrown weapons.

### Equipment: Magic Items

Magic items have costs and can be purchased and sold. However, buyers and sellers of magic items can generally only be found in large cities, and certain magic items may be more difficult to obtain than others. Consult the Game Master whenever you wish to purchase or sell a magic item. For magic item costs and weights, see [Consumable Magic Items](../consumable_magic_items) and [Permanent Magic Items](../permanent_magic_items).
