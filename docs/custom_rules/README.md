## Consent

The players and the Game Master must each carefully read and fill out the [RPG Consent Checklist](https://mcpl.info/sites/default/files/images/consent-in-gaming-form-fillable-checklist-2019-09-13.pdf) and hand it over to the Game Master before the start of the campaign. The Game Master then aggregates and anonymizes the results and posts them for the gaming group to see. Players and the Game Master are expected to adhere to these restrictions on RPG story elements during play. Failure to do so results in warnings, and serious or repeated offences result in expulsion from the gaming group.

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Character Creation: Basics

When making your character, you may choose your race, subrace, background, class(es), subclass(es), feats, spells, and equipment from any of the official published 5th Edition Dungeon and Dragons books by Wizards of the Coast. You may not use any Unearthed Arcana material, playtest material, or homebrew material.

Unless otherwise stated, start with 0 XP at 1st level. If you are creating a replacement character because your previous character died or was retired, consult the Game Master regarding your starting experience and level.

Use the Point Buy system for your starting ability scores. For a list of all possible starting ability score arrays using the Point Buy system, see [Character Creation – Ability Scores](../character_creation#ability-scores).

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Race and Class

You may customize your race as described in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*. You cannot choose a race that has a base flying speed, such as the Aarakocra, the Winged Tiefling, the Fairy, and so on.

Some races are missing official heights and weights, and some races have inconsistent heights and weights. See [Character Creation – Height and Weight](../character_creation/#height-and-weight) for more consistent height and weight data. Your height and weight must lie within the minimum and maximum bounds of this data.

Regarding your 1st-level class, use the variant rule from the *Player's Handbook* where you start with coinage instead of equipment. This starting coinage depends only on your 1st-level class; you do not receive any starting coinage or equipment from your background. Use your starting coinage to purchase your starting equipment. See [Character Creation – Wealth](../character_creation#wealth) for a list of starting coinage by class. Do not roll dice; simply take the average value.

Above 1st level, you may multiclass. Your multiclass selections must make sense given your character's backstory and experiences during the campaign.

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Background and Personality

You may customize your background as described in the *Player's Handbook*. In summary:

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Each background grants proficiency in two skills. You may choose any two skills.
- **Language and Tool Proficiencies:** Each background grants proficiency in either two languages, two tools, or one language and one tool. You may choose any of these categories, and make any choices within that category. Languages and tools are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Additional details regarding tools are described in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*.
- **Starting Equipment:** Since we are using the variant rule where you start with coinage instead of equipment, you do not receive any starting coinage or equipment from your background.
- **Feature:** Each background grants a passive feature. This is what effectively identifies the background, so you gain this feature as usual.

Your alignment, personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw must:

- fit the campaign setting and tone,
- be consistent with the adventuring party's goal,
- be such that you want to go on adventures with the adventuring party, and
- be such that you generally get along with your fellow adventuring party members.

You may choose your two personality traits, your ideal, your bond, and your flaw from any background. See:

- [Character Creation – Personality Traits](../character_creation/#personality-traits) for a list of personality traits from all backgrounds,
- [Character Creation – Ideals](../character_creation/#ideals) for a list of ideals from all backgrounds,
- [Character Creation – Bonds](../character_creation/#bonds) for a list of bonds from all backgrounds, and
- [Character Creation – Flaws](../character_creation/#flaws) for a list of flaws from all backgrounds.

Your bond must involve one of your fellow adventuring party members. You may optionally have a second bond unrelated to the adventuring party.

You are assumed to have a modest lifestyle, which costs 1 gp per day when staying in a settlement.

[(Back to Character Creation)](#character-creation)

### Character Creation: Backstory and Portrait

Write a short backstory of a few paragraphs. The purpose of your backstory is to explain your background, your bond, your 1st-level class, and your other character details. Your backstory must include the following:

- **Background:** One paragraph of your backstory must explain your background, including any non-player characters or factions from your background's passive feature.
- **Bond:** One paragraph of your backstory must explain your bond(s).
- **Class:** One paragraph of your backstory must explain your 1st-level class and subclass as well as any other classes you plan on taking in the future if you choose to multiclass.
- You may optionally write one or more additional paragraphs to explain your alignment, personality traits, ideal, and flaw.

Your backstory must fit the campaign setting and tone, and your backstory must be appropriate for your starting level. Greatness is something that is earned while adventuring, not something that is written into a backstory.

Find an image depicting your character, ideally a full-body image or a "from the waist up" image, to serve as your character's portrait. Your portrait must fit the campaign setting and tone, and your portrait cannot be lewd or inappropriate.

## Equipment

- [Encumbrance](#equipment-encumbrance)
- [Wilderness](#equipment-wilderness)
- [Ammunition](#equipment-ammunition)
- [Thrown Weapons](#equipment-thrown-weapons)
- [Magic Items](#equipment-magic-items)

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Equipment: Encumbrance

Use the variant encumbrance rule from the *Player's Handbook*, with the following modifications:

- Bipedal creatures can carry weight in pounds up to 5 times their Strength score without penalty.
- Bipedal creatures carrying weight in pounds of 5 to 10 times their Strength score causes them to become encumbered: their speed is reduced by 10 feet.
- Bipedal creature carrying weight in excess of 10 times their Strength score causes them to become heavily encumbered: their speed is reduced by 20 feet and they has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
- Non-bipedal creatures can carry twice as much weight.
- Creatures cannot fly while encumbered or heavily encumbered.

Keep track of how many copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp) you carry on your person. Electrum pieces are not used. 50 coins weigh 1 lb as usual. You can exchange coins for coins of different denominations in most settlements:

- 10 cp = 1 sp
- 10 sp = 1 gp
- 10 gp = 1 pp

Instead of carrying all of your coinage on your person, you can deposit excess coinage at a bank. Large cities are home to various international banks. Consult the Game Master when doing so.

[(Back to Equipment)](#equipment)

### Equipment: Wilderness

While adventuring in the wilderness, you must have the following equipment at minimum:

- Suit of armor or traveler's clothes (2 gp, 4 lb)
- Backpack (2 gp, 5 lb)
- Bedroll (1 gp, 7 lb)
- Blanket (5 sp, 3 lb)
- Mess kit (2 sp, 1 lb)
- Waterskin (2 sp, 5 lb)

Each adventurer must have their own copy of the above equipment. However, you can ask one of your companions to carry your equipment for you.

While traveling through the wilderness, keep track of how many rations you you have as you consume them each day. You also drink the contents of one waterskin per day (or more depending on the climate), so you will usually need to find a source of water each day.

[(Back to Equipment)](#equipment)

### Equipment: Ammunition

If you carry one standard bundle of mundane ammunition along with an appropriate container for this ammunition, it is assumed that you effectively have a limitless supply of ammunition of that type, such that you do not need to keep track of its expenditure. Darts also follow this rule: if you have 10 darts, you are assumed to have an effectively limitless supply and do not need to keep track of how many you have thrown. Thus, this applies to:

- **Bow:** Quiver (1 gp, 1 lb) and 20 arrows (1 gp, 1 lb).
- **Crossbow:** Crossbow bolt case (1 gp, 1 lb) and 20 crossbow bolts (1 gp, 1.5 lb).
- **Sling:** Pouch (5 sp, 1 lb) and 20 sling bullets (4 cp, 1.5 lb).
- **Blowgun:** Pouch (5 sp, 1 lb) and 50 blowgun needles (1 gp, 1 lb).
- **Darts:** 10 darts (5 sp, 2.5 lb).

However, magical ammunition (such as a +1 arrow, +1 crossbow bolt, and so on) is expended when used.

[(Back to Equipment)](#equipment)

### Equipment: Thrown Weapons

If you carry 5 copies of a mundane melee weapon with the thrown property (such as 5 javelins, 5 handaxes, 5 daggers, and so on), you are assumed to have an effectively limitless supply of that weapon, so you do not need to keep track of how many you have thrown.

However, magical thrown weapons (such as a +1 javelin) need to be counted individually. If you have a few moments after combat, you can usually pick up your magical thrown weapons.

### Equipment: Magic Items

Magic items have costs and can be purchased and sold. However, buyers and sellers of magic items can generally only be found in large cities, and certain magic items may be more difficult to obtain than others. Consult the Game Master whenever you wish to purchase or sell a magic item. For magic item costs and weights, see [Consumable Magic Items](../consumable_magic_items) and [Permanent Magic Items](../permanent_magic_items).

## Progression

- [Levelling](#progression-levelling)
- [Absenteeism](#progression-absenteeism)
- [Death and Retirement](#progression-death-and-retirement)

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Progression: Levelling

Your character can only level-up in-between game sessions. When you acquire enough experience points to level-up, wait until the end of the game session to do so.

[(Back to Progression)](#progression)

### Progression: Absenteeism

If you are absent during a game session, your character "fades into the background": you are assumed to follow the adventuring party around, but you cannot directly impact the game, and the game cannot directly impact you. While absent, you do not receive any experience points or treasure except for quest rewards.

Strictly more than half of all players must be present for a game session to take place. If there are not enough players, the session is cancelled.

If a player is present at the game table, they gain experience points. Experience points are considered to be a property of the player that carry over to the player's current character. Thus, experience points transfer from a player's dead or retired character to their next character.

[(Back to Progression)](#progression)

### Progression: Death and Retirement

If your character dies or retires, you may make a new character. Your new character starts with the same total experience points as your previous one. Consult the game master when making a new character.

Unlike experience points, treasure and equipment is lost when your character dies or retires. If you have enough experience points for your new character to start at 2nd level or higher, you start with additional wealth, which you can use to purchase additional mundane or magic equipment in addition to your normal 1st-level starting equipment. Your additional starting wealth depends on your level; see [Character Creation – Starting Wealth](../character_creation/#starting-wealth).

## Adventuring

- [Going Unconscious](#adventuring-going-unconscious)
- [Movement](#adventuring-movement)
- [Falling](#adventuring-falling)
- [Travel](#adventuring-travel)

[(Back to Top)](#)

### Adventuring: Going Unconscious

Each time you are reduced to 0 hit points, you gain one level of exhaustion.

After you make a death saving throw but before it takes effect, you may choose to gain two levels of exhaustion to reroll your death saving throw, using either result.

[(Back to Adventuring)](#adventuring)

### Adventuring: Movement

Movement on a grid uses the 3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragons rule for diagonal movement: every second diagonal tile of movement costs an additional 5 feet of movement. This simple rule very closely approximates real diagonal movement.

Vertical movement such as climbing and flying is counted separately from horizontal movement, even when moving diagonally-upwards or diagonally-downwards.

Flying speeds apply to horizontal and downwards flight. Upwards flight is more strenuous: each foot of upwards flight costs an additional foot of movement.

[(Back to Adventuring)](#adventuring)

### Adventuring: Falling

When you fall, if you are conscious, subtract your running high jump distance (a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier) from your fall distance to determine your effective fall distance. When you land, you take bludgeoning damage based on your size and your effective fall distance as shown in the following table. You can make a Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage taken. The DC for this save equals 10 + 1 for each 10 ft of effective fall distance. You fall prone if you take any damage from falling.

|  Distance  | Save DC | Tiny  | Small | Medium | Large | Huge  | Garg. |
| :--------: | :-----: | :---: | :---: | :----: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

### Adventuring: Travel

Your speed determines your normal travel pace as shown in the following table.

| Speed  | Hourly Pace | Daily Pace |       | Speed  | Hourly Pace | Daily Pace |
| :----: | :---------: | :--------: | :---: | :----: | :---------: | :--------: |
|   5 ft |   ½ mi/hr   |  4 mi/day  |       |  50 ft |   5 mi/hr   | 40 mi/day  |
|  10 ft |   1 mi/hr   |  8 mi/day  |       |  60 ft |   6 mi/hr   | 48 mi/day  |
|  15 ft |  1½ mi/hr   | 12 mi/day  |       |  70 ft |   7 mi/hr   | 56 mi/day  |
|  20 ft |   2 mi/hr   | 16 mi/day  |       |  80 ft |   8 mi/hr   | 64 mi/day  |
|  25 ft |  2½ mi/hr   | 20 mi/day  |       |  90 ft |   9 mi/hr   | 72 mi/day  |
|  30 ft |   3 mi/hr   | 24 mi/day  |       | 100 ft |  10 mi/hr   | 80 mi/day  |
|  35 ft |  3½ mi/hr   | 28 mi/day  |       | 110 ft |  11 mi/hr   | 88 mi/day  |
|  40 ft |   4 mi/hr   | 32 mi/day  |       | 120 ft |  12 mi/hr   | 96 mi/day  |

Terrain affects your travel pace:

- Paved road: normal travel pace.
- Unpaved path: reduces your travel pace to three quarters of its normal value.
- Cross-country through normal terrain such as grass, soil, or rock: reduces your travel pace to half its normal value.
- Cross-country through difficult terrain such as sand, mud, forests, swamps, hills, mountains, ice, or snow: reduces your travel pace to one quarter of its normal value.

Bad weather such as heavy rains, blizzards, or hurricane winds can slow your travel pace even further.
