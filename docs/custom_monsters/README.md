## Monster and Player Character Equivalence

The following table shows the approximate combat equivalence between monster challenge ratings (CR) and player character levels. For example, a CR 1 monster is roughly equivalent to a 3rd-level player character in combat. Similarly, if a CR 1 monster is a spellcaster, it is likely a 3rd-level spellcaster.

| Monster CR | Player Character | Sample Monsters |
| :--------: | :--------------: | :-------------- |
|    CR 0    |        –         | Commoner, crawling claw, homunculus |
|    CR ⅛    |        –         | Bandit, kobold, manes demon, stirge |
|    CR ¼    |     1st Level    | Goblin, pixie, skeleton, zombie |
|    CR ½    |     2nd Level    | Gnoll, hobgoblin, lizardfolk, orc |
|    CR 1    |     3rd Level    | Animated armor, bugbear, ghoul, imp |
|    CR 2    |     4th Level    | Centaur, gargoyle, griffon, ogre |
|    CR 3    |   5th–6th Level  | Basilisk, hell hound, minotaur, mummy |
|    CR 4    |     7th Level    | Banshee, flameskull, succubus |
|    CR 5    |     8th Level    | Bulette, hill giant, troll, wraith |
|    CR 6    |     9th Level    | Chimera, cyclops, vrock demon, wyvern |
|    CR 7    |    10th Level    | Drow mage, illithid, stone giant |
|    CR 8    |    11th Level    | Fomorian, frost giant, hydra |
|    CR 9    |    12th Level    | Cloud giant, glabrezu demon, treant |
|   CR 10    | 13th–14th Level  | Aboleth, eladrin, stone golem |

|   CR 12    | 17th–18th Level  | Boneclaw, eidolon, erinyes |
|   CR 13    | 19th–20th Level  | Beholder, rakshasa, storm giant |

## Custom Monster Table

The following table shows the typical statistics of monsters of various challenge ratings. As usual, follow the guidelines in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* when customizing monsters.

Abbreviations:

- **CR:** Challenge rating of the monster.
- **XP:** Experience points awarded for defeating a monster of this challenge rating.
- **Coins:** Coinage typically carried by a monster of this challenge rating. Not all monsters carry coinage on their person, but those that do can typically be expected to carry the listed amount.
- **Prof:** Proficiency bonus of all monsters of this challenge rating.
- **Ability Scores:** Typical ability score array for monsters of this challenge rating. A monster's actual ability score array can vary greatly from the listed array, though the sum of all ability scores typically equals the sum of the listed ability scores.
- **AC:** Typical Armor Class for monsters of this challenge rating. Can vary substantially depending on the monster. Monsters with lower Armor Class typically either have more hit points or a higher average damage per round, and vice-versa.
- **HP:** Typical hit points for monsters of this challenge rating. Can vary substantially depending on the monster. Monsters with fewer hit points typically either have higher Armor Class or a higher average damage per round, and vice-versa.
- **Atk:** Typical attack bonus for monsters of this challenge rating.
- **Save DC:** Typical saving throw DC for the spells and effects of monsters of this challenge rating.
- **DPR:** Typical average damage per round assuming that all attacks hit and that all effects trigger for monsters of this challenge rating. Can vary substantially depending on the monster. Monsters with lower average damage per round typically either have higher Armor Class or more hit points, and vice-versa.
