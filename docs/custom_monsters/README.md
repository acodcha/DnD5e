## Monster and Player Character Equivalence

The following table shows the approximate combat equivalence between monster challenge ratings and player character levels. For example, a CR 1 monster is roughly equivalent to a 3rd-level player character in combat. Similarly, if a CR 1 monster is a spellcaster, it is likely a 3rd-level spellcaster.

| Monster Challenge Rating | Player Character Level |
| :---: | :-------: |
| CR ¼  |    1st    |
| CR ½  |    2nd    |
| CR 1  |    3rd    |
| CR 2  |    4th    |
| CR 3  |  5th–6th  |
| CR 4  |    7th    |
| CR 5  |    8th    |
| CR 6  |    9th    |
| CR 7  |   10th    |
| CR 8  |   11th    |
| CR 9  |   12th    |
| CR 10 | 13th–14th |
| CR 11 | 15th–16th |
| CR 12 | 17th–18th |
| CR 13 | 19th–20th |
