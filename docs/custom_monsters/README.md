## Monster and Player Character Equivalence

The following table shows the approximate combat equivalence between monster challenge ratings (CR) and player character levels. For example, a CR 1 monster is roughly equivalent to a 3rd-level player character in combat. Similarly, if a CR 1 monster is a spellcaster, it is likely a 3rd-level spellcaster.

Abbreviations:

- **CR:** Challenge rating of the monster.

- **Prof:** Proficiency bonus of all monsters of this challenge rating.
