## Treasure Hoards
The following table lists the contents of treasure hoards. Each treasure hoard contains coinage, gems, art objects, consumable magic items, and permanent magic items. Note that all content is listed **per player**. ½ × means 1 item per 2 players. ¼ × means 1 item per 4 players. Over the course of a campaign, players are expected to find one treasure hoard per level from 1st to 20th level.

For example, a party of four 1st-level player characters can expect to loot a treasure hoard containing a total of 40 gp, 4 × 10 gp gems, 2 × 25 gp art objects, 4 × 40 gp consumable magic items, and 1 × 200 gp permanent magic items during 1st level.

This table assumes that players are able to purchase magic items throughout the campaign using their accumulated wealth; if this is not the case, then treasure hoards should contain twice as many magic items.
